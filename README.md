# ExActR: A Shiny App for Creating Ecosystem Extent Accounts

`ExActR` (Extent Accounts in R) is an open-source R Shiny application for generating ecosystem extent accounts using shapefiles, a geospatial vector data format. The app is designed to assist in integrating nature into sustainable decision-making by implementing the first pillar of the System of Environmental Economic Accountingâ€“Ecosystem Accounting (SEEA-EA) framework.

## Features

- Multiple Timepoints Support: Generate extent accounts for consecutive pairs of timepoints to accommodate dynamic ecosystem assessments over multiple periods.
- Interactive Visualizations: Create both interactive (Leaflet) and static maps for each timepoint.
- Land Cover Change Analysis: Produce bar plots illustrating land type composition and changes over time.
- Data Export: Copy tables into multiple formats, including LaTeX, for seamless integration into reports.
- Versatility: Compatible with any spatial grouping variable and adaptable to various land cover classification systems.
- User-Friendly Interface: Built with R Shiny for an interactive and responsive user experience.

## Prerequisites

To install and use the app locally

- R (version 4.0 or higher)
- RStudio (recommended)
- Git (if cloning the repository)

## Installation
